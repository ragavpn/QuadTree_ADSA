# QuadTree_ADSA
This project uses a QuadTree-based image compression algorithm with varius features implemented. Some of them include Lossless Compression, Batch and parallel processing, Preprocessing of image using Chroma Subsampling and much more. There are also various "Checkpoints" which are basically code for different features mentioned.

Feel free to check out the metrics checkpoint to see Our compression algorithm's performance versus other algorithms already existing such as JPEG and WEBP.
